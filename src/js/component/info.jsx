                    Everyone has a different experience but flying for the first time feels pretty 
                    incredible. The general feeling is similar to that on a fast elevator. You will 
                    feel the gravity at work as you take off. Some might feel a little fuzzy sensation in the head.<p></p>
                    Is flying a good way to travel?
                    By flying you avoid other land-bound issues too, like road blocks and traffic snarls and sudden diversions.
                    Flying helps you make the most of your holiday by taking you places with speed and efficient use of time.
                    Familiarity- the pilots who fly the route know the space intimately.</p>
